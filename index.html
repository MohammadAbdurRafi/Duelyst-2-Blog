              This is a website where we introduce new players to Duelyst 2.
              Like many card games, Duelyst 2 is a tactical game, but uses an unconventional method of battling.
              Instead of being a plain battlefield for everyone to fight one another, Duelyst 2 uses a Chess-like board for combat.
              Cast powerful spells, Summon mysterious minions, and Lead your army to victory as a general of your faction.

            <h4>Lyonar</h4>
            <p>
              Lyonar is the main splinter of the original human tribe, spanning throughout the land and making heavy usage of solar magic.
              The Lyonar represent the majority of humanity by having large, sturdy armies and incredible healing spells.
            </p>

              <h4>Songhai</h4>
              <p>
                The Songhai Empire is the second largest splinter of the original human tribe after the Lyonar Kingdoms.
                They have heavily adapted to the most lethal expanses of the world of Mythron, in the closed and remote jungles where hyperpredators and deadly 
                blossoms lie.
              </p>

              <h4>Vetruvian</h4>
              <p>
                The Vetruvian Imperium is the "nation of tinkerers" of Mythron.
                They are the inventors fo Sandshields, originally armors and cybernetics to enable them to survive in their harsh desert environment, and now implant
                limbs and weaponry widely used by generals and other Mythron denizens.
              </p>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-locust"></i>
              <h4>Abyssian</h4>
              <p>
                The Abyssian Host is a weird humanoid offshoot coming from reptiles instead of mammals, living in deep underground caves, aggressive and obsessed with
                becoming the apex life form of Mythron. In this species, the males and females follow very different paths of physical evolution and behavior.
              </p>

            <li>

              <h4>Magmar</h4>
              <p>
                The Magmar are a consort of 13 reincarnating saurian, the first sentient beings on the world of Mythron.
                As the elders, they try to guide societies in a path they perceive being best for world peace, also making gene experiments on local mega fauna for their
                own purposes.
              </p>

              <h4>Vanar</h4>
              <p>
                The Vanar Kindred are the original human tribe, very much in touch with the transmorphic properties of the world tree.
                Their shamanic customs translate into metamorphic tendencies.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-face-meh"></i>
              <h4>Neutral</h4>
              <p>
                Neutral minions tell the untold story of the world of Duelyst.
                Some are mercenaries, weathered veterans of war called to rally behind the banner of another faction in the most dire of times.
                Others are wildlife, strategically utilized by the Generals to turn their natural surroudings into a great asset.
                Each neutral minion has its own tale to tell, and each is ready to serve you with unwavering devotion.
